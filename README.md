# OpenGL Samples
A collection of visual effects, rendering techniques, and small samples to experiment with OpenGL. 
Note that code simplicity is preferred, and abstractions over raw OpenGL calls are hence kept to a minimum.
   
## Sample List
| [GPU-Driven Particles](https://github.com/sevanetrebchenko/opengl-samples/tree/master/src/samples/particles) |
| :---: |
| ![Particles]() <br> A simulation of 20+ million particles based on simple Newtonian dynamics on the GPU. |

| [GLSL Path Tracing](https://github.com/sevanetrebchenko/opengl-samples/tree/master/src/samples/path-tracing) |
| :---: |
| ![Path Tracing](https://github.com/sevanetrebchenko/opengl-samples/blob/master/src/samples/path-tracing/data/screenshots/result.jpg) <br> A real-time path tracer implemented in a GLSL shader program complete with visual de-noising, customizable material properties, and a physically-based camera model with HDR tonemapping and depth of field. |
